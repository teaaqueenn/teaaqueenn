## Hi I'm Grace :)

I wrote my first lines of code in 5th grade while competing in FIRST LEGO League, and soon after, I built a (very buggy) video game in JavaScript. Although I took a break from programming during middle school, I rediscovered my passion for coding in high school and have been building ever since.
